# Pinyin Flashcards

A small personal project I made to practice **Mandarin Chinese Pinyin**.  

It was a bit hectic to ask someone to read out pinyin so I could practice writing Hanzi,  
so I made this simple flashcard web page: see a Pinyin word, check the Hanzi + English if you want, then move to the next one.

## How to Use

1. Download or clone this repo.  
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.  
3. Click on the **card** to flip and see Hanzi + English.  
4. Click **Next** to move to the next word.  
5. Cards loop endlessly, so you can keep practicing.

## What’s Inside

- A web page with 150 common Pinyin words.  
- Simple **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**—no backend needed.  
- Minimal design, made just for personal practice.

## Future Ideas

- Add more HSK words as I level up my Mandarin.  
- Maybe add automatic flipping or timed practice mode.  

Just a fun little project to help me (and maybe others) learn Mandarin!
